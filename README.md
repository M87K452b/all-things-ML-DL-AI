  - Breath First Search
  - Deapth First Search
  - Uniform Cost Graph Search

## 2. [Time Series Predictions for stock data](https://github.com/M87K452b/timeseries-prediction-lstm-applectock)
Timeseries predictions of stock data using LSTM neural networks.

## 3. [MNIST hand written digit classification using tenserflow and keras](https://github.com/M87K452b/mnist-image-classification)
Categorical image classification of images using MNIST hand written digit dataset,tensorflow and keras.

## 4. [Regression Learning - Housing Price prediction](https://github.com/M87K452b/regression-learning-housing-prices)

## 5. [Cancer Classification Project](https://github.com/M87K452b/breast-cancer-classification)
Categorical Classification Project of Breast cancer wisconsin (diagnostic) dataset using Tensorflow 2.0 & Keras.

## 6. [Deep Learning - Porfolio Project](https://github.com/M87K452b/deep-learning-loan-prediction)
Given historical data on loans given out with information on whether or not the borrower defaulted (charge-off), 
a model that can predict wether a borrower will pay back their loan is built. This is a binary classification type
of prediction.
